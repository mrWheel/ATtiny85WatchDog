# ATtiny85WatchDog
Using an ATtiny85 as WatchDog for an other processor

The objective is to have a means to monitor activity on a master processor, for instance, an ESP8266 (or ESP32 or any
other type of processor).

The master processor needs to send at least every `_MAX_HALF_SECONDS` seconds a "Keep Alive" pulse to the WatchDog 
[WDT-FEED] (the 3v3 signal is level-shifted by Q1 to [WDT] (PB2, DIL-7)). If the WatchDog does not receive this 
pulse in time it will make [ESP-RESET] (PB3, DIL-2) HIGH for 500 msec to reset the master processor. In the Firmware PB1 is available as OUTPUT pin for an extra LED (REL_LED)

In the image above you see a typical reset circuit for an ESP processor. [ESP-RESET] comes from the ATtiny85 (PB3, DIL-2). 
The Q3 MOSFET works as a level-shifter (if needed) and on a HIGH signal it will pull [RESET] down.

PB4 (DIL-3) on the ATtiny85 is used to control (in this case) relays but this is not needed for every implementation. 
PB0 (DIL-5) outputs a signal to the [WDT-LED] (D2) which will, after every received "Keep Alive" pulse go "HIGH" for 
500 milliseconds). Two seconds before the circuit will reset the master processor the PWM_LED will blink rapidly.
